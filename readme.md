This project is a first attempt at creating a website using all
the lessons taught up until the 'Project: Recipes" lesson in the Odin Project.
These skills include proper syntax and structure to HTML files, the appropriate use
of multiple tags (h, p, br, a, img ).
This also marks the first major use of Git and Github for a more involved project, which are relevent skills in themselves.

By the time the project is finished, all the skills above will have been demonstrated.
